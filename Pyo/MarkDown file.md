### I was stuck installing the poy. I followed the steps Rachel provided until I got to the last step which was "sudo python3 setup.py install --use-coreaudio -debug".
 - python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
 - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 - hit "Return"
 - brew install liblo libsndfile portaudio portmidi
 - git clone https://github.com/belangeo/pyo.git
 - cd pyo
 - sudo python3 setup.py install --use-coreaudio --debug ï¼ˆ I also tried "python setup.py install --use-coreaudio --use-double".)

### Then I got a big error report. These include the following examples.

- src/engine/ad_coreaudio.c:132:21: error: implicit declaration of function 'AudioGetCurrentHostTime' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    now.mHostTime = AudioGetCurrentHostTime();
    36 warnings and 1 error generated.
    error: command '/usr/bin/gcc' failed with exit code 1

### I tried to Google for help, but there was no answer that worked. I also tried re-updating python and the computer system version, but always the same problem. I'm lost and don't know what to do to fix it.
