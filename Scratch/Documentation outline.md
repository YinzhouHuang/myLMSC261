# Puppy astronaut plays giant piano
- I made a puppy that can play the piano with a computer numeric keyboard.
- My first goal was to build the code for the piano. When I didn't know what to do at first I clicked into the extended code on the right and found the music section, which felt very interesting. I then chose the instrument as the piano and found the option to play specific notes, so I used the code in the event section to allow me to map the numeric keyboard to the piano notes. Then to show the feeling of playing, I found a puppy and used the code to control it to move to the coordinates where the corresponding notes are when playing different notes.
- I basically didn't have any problems this time, I just spent some time thinking about what code to use.
