- The biggest difficulty was that we needed to use branches in Github and collaborate in zoom. Although we had some interesting ideas, we had some problems with how to integrate the various branches when building the site, which led to the site not being completed. We spent an inordinate amount of time integrating everyone's information, which also left me a bit overwhelmed at the beginning. At first I wasn't quite sure if we needed 4 people to complete a site together or individually, and after an hour of work, I decided that zoom would be more difficult to complete together than individually. Although we worked on our own branches, Jeongwoo had trouble integrating our work at the end, so the site didn't quite show our final product in the end.
